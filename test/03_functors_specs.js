/*
 * JUST ENOUGH CATEGORY THEORY:
 *
 *  1 - FORMING A CATEGORY:
 *
 *    You need a composition function and an identity function to form a CATEGORY:
 *      compose :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
 *      id      :: a -> a
 *
 *  2 - CATEGORY LAWS:
 *
 *    LEFT IDENTITY:  compose(id,f)            == f
 *    RIGHT IDENTITY: compose(f,id)            == f
 *    ASSOCIATIVITY:  compose(compose(f,g), h) == compose(f, compose(g,h))
 *
 *  3 - CATEGORY LAWS USING HASKELL NOTATION:
 *
 *    LEFT IDENTITY:  id . f      = f
 *    RIGHT IDENTITY: f . id      = f
 *    ASSOCIATIVITY:  (f . g) . h = f . (g . h)
